Oh, that was short audio. Yeah. All right, team, let's get started with our weekly updates on the robot arm project. I'd like to go around and hear what everyone has accomplished this past week and what's still on your pet plates. I've come up. I've completed the initial CAD designs for the servo housing and wrist joint. The 3D prints came out well, but we need to make some adjustments to improve the torque capacity at the elbow joint. I finished running the base motor control algorithms and tested them on the prototype. The precision is when? 0.3 mm of our target, which meets specs. I still need to integrate the feedback sensors by March 8th so we can continue the full motion sensoring.
