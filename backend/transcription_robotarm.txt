Alright team, let's get started with our weekly update on the robot arm project. I'd like to go around and hear what everyone has accomplished this past week and what's still on your plates. I've completed the initial CAD designs for the servo housing and wrist joint. The 3D prints came out well, but we need to make some adjustments to improve the torque capacity at the elbow joint. I've finished writing the base motor control algorithms and tested them on the prototype. The precision is within 0.3mm of our target, which meets specs. I still need to integrate the feedback sensors by March 8th so we can start the full motion testing. On the electrical side, I've completed the PCB design and sent it for manufacturing. They promised delivery by March 5th. Once we receive them, I'll need about three days to assemble and test the boards. So I should have working control circuits by March 8th. I've been working on the gripper mechanism. The pneumatic system is operational, but I'm having issues with the pressure sensors. I need to recalibrate them and finish the gripper testing by March 10th at the latest. I'll also need some help once the circuit boards are ready. I've completed the initial software architecture and the UI for controlling the arm. I'm currently working on implementing the inverse kinematics algorithms. I should have that done by March 7th, and then I'll need to integrate with the control systems by March 12th. Great. I've been coordinating with the client and finalizing the project documentation. We need to have a working prototype for the client demo on March 15th. Based on what I'm hearing, we should be on track if we stick to these deadlines. Let's make sure the integration testing starts no later than March 12th, which gives us three days to troubleshoot before the demo. Can you make sure the power supply issues we saw last time are resolved by then? Yes, I've already ordered the new components. They should arrive by March 4th, and I'll prioritize that fix. Perfect. Please work on the gripper-arm integration as soon as your pressure sensor issues are resolved. We'll need those CAD adjustments by March 6th so we can print the revised parts in time. Once your kinematics work is done, can you also help with the demo preparation software? Sure thing. I'll set aside time after March 12th for that. Great work everyone. Let's meet again next Monday to check our progress. Remember, all individual components need to be completed by March 10th so we have adequate time for integration and testing before the client demo on the 15th.
